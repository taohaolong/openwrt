	bool "Smedia Glamo 336x/337x support"
	help
	  This enables the core driver for the Smedia Glamo 336x/337x
	  multi-function device.  It includes irq_chip demultiplex as
	  well as clock / power management and GPIO support.

	help
	  Frame buffer driver for the LCD controller in the Smedia Glamo
	  336x/337x.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). The
	  module will be called glamofb. If you want to compile it as a module,
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  If unsure, say N.
