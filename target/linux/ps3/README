OpenWRT on Sony PS3 Game Console

To install the built image, you'll need to copy bin/otheros.bld to a
USB device, MMC card or CD image. The image will need to be placed
on your media, at the path:

  /ps3/otheros/otheros.bld

Then insert the media into the ps3, and navigate to 'Install Other OS'
in the PS3's menu.

Depending on your monitor, you may need to alter the kernel command
line options. The default is to autodetect, which should work on most
monitors. However, if you get a blank screen on boot, or you'd like to
use a different resolution, you can specify a different video mode.

To do this, 'make kernel_menuconfig' and go to 'Kernel Options' ->
'Initial kernel command string', and add a video= parameter - for
example "video=720p". You can also specify a vide mode explicitly,
for example "video=9" for 1080i at 50Hz. Possible mode ids are:

Video mode ID:
 0:auto mode
 YUV 60Hz  1:480i  2:480p  3:720p  4:1080i  5:1080p
 YUV 50Hz  6:576i  7:576p  8:720p  9:1080i 10:1080p
 RGB 60Hz 33:480i 34:480p 35:720p 36:1080i 37:1080p
 RGB 50Hz 38:576i 39:576p 40:720p 41:1080i 42:1080p
 VESA     11:WXGA 12:SXGA 13:WUXGA

 full screen mode: <video mode ID> + 128
 dither ON mode  : <video mode ID> + 2048
